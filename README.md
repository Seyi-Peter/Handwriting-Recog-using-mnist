## Overview

This project demonstrates handwriting digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It is implemented in Python with TensorFlow and Keras and trained on the well-known MNIST dataset consisting of 70,000 handwritten digits (0â€“9).

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that achieves high accuracy in classifying handwritten digits. The project is developed and tested in Google Colab.

## Features

* Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
* Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
* Trains the model on 60,000 images and tests on 10,000 images.
* Achieves around 98% accuracy on test data.
* Includes visualization of training history (accuracy and loss curves).
* Provides prediction examples with true vs. predicted labels.

## Results

* Test Accuracy: \~98%
* Example predictions are shown with the actual digit label and model output.
* Training history plots illustrate the accuracy and loss during training.

---

## Future Improvements
